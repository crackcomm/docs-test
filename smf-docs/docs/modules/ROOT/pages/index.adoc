~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*smf* is a new RPC system and code generation like gRPC, Cap n Proto,
Apache Thrift, etc, but designed for *microsecond tail latency*.

Current benchmarks in microseconds

|60 byte payload |latency
|p50 |7us
|p90 |8us
|p99 |8us
|p9999 |15us
|p100 |26us
|========================

Highlights:
~~~~~~~~~~~

* Code generation compiler for RPC
* Load testing framework for RPC subsystem
* Kernel-bypass RPC via DPDK
* 0-copy Serialization framework based on Google’s Flatbuffers project
* Arbitrary filter chaining on incoming and outgoing channels (like
twitter’s Finagle)
* Small 16byte overhead
* Binary with pluggable compressors

We need your help!
