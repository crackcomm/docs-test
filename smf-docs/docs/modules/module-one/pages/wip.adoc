`smf::condor` is a proposal to autogenerate an oracle that would proxy
the requests between any two systems to systematically explore failures
of distributed systems using the `smf` RPC.

Lineage Driven Fault Injection (LDFI) is a method for finding faults by
reasnoning backwards (_hazard step_) from correct results to determine
whether failures in the execution could have prevented that result.

Failures explored:

* permanent crashed failrues
* message loss
* network partitions.

Failures not explored:

* byzantine failures
* crash-recovery

The ideas for `smf::condor` come from Molly, a design and implementation
by P. Alvaro, J. Rosen and J Hellerstine. These 2 systems differ in
significant ways:

* Molly evalues a dadalus program (datalog-like langugage)
* `smf:condor` is an extension to an RPC generator and the first phase
will not implement a hazard step automatically.

The idea behind Molly is that, in the context of a protocol, every state
change has pre-conditions, execution and post-conditions. Therefore when
there is a match of the same pre-conditions but different
post-conditions, the system has found a failure!

Molly first runs a _forward step_ of a distributed program given a set
of inputs, obtaining an outcome. Then _hazard step_ tries deduce
everything that had to happen to produce that outcome and see if it can
make it not true. That is, how can the system inject a failure to make
the outcome not true.

For example, say your protocol for an RPC was this:

[source,flatbuffers]
....


rpc_service MyService {

   // return | x |
   int abs(int x);
}

....

A _forward step_ would be, give `MyService::abs(1)` and see it return
`1`. It is key to record the result of `1` as the system needs the
lineage-enriched output.

The _hazard step_ would be to pass the inputs and recorded outputs to a
SAT solver and have the SAT solver try to break it by for exmaple,
giving it `MyService::abs(-INF)`.

Molly has many merits. In particular the mental model it gives
programmers to reason about sensitivity to implementation mistakes.

Some protocols for example expect perfect unique idâ€™s for transactions
or deduplication. These protocols fail if you control the source of
entropy (i.e.: /dev/urandom ) for generating these ids. Message replay
of the same could cause catastrophic failures - such as double charging
your bitcoins.

Molly list the faults that any general-purpose verifyer should have. I
will focus on the RPC general-purpose verifyer as an abstraction layer
such that with zero work you get a state of the art fault-injector.

* Message loss: `drop n out of N`
* Crash failures: `sys.exit(1)`
* Nondeterminisim in ordering and timing:
`add arbitrary delayes per message(rpc) same as above for RPC`

Note that this system is for correctness and not
